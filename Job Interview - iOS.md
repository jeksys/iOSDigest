## iOS Specific interview questions
Value types in swift (primitives, array, string, dictionary, struct, enum, and tuple) [Value and Reference Types](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=10)

⋅⋅* What are Optionals?
#### A variable that can indicate whether they hold a value or not. Optionals will be "nil" if they don't have a value.

⋅⋅* What is a protocol?
#### A protocol will tell the class, struct, or enum which adopts it what methods and properties it must implement.

What is the delegation?
#### Delegation is a design pattern that enables a class or structure to hand off (or delegate) some of its responsibilities to an instance of another type
